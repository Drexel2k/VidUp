# Drexel’s VidUp - A Youtube Video Uploader
## Privacy Policy

21. December 2021

VidUp does not store or process any user data or shares it with internal or other external parties than Google/YouTube.

VidUp uses YouTube Data API to interact with YouTube (both owned by Google), by accepting this privacy policy and using the app you also accept the Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US.

On OAuth Authentication VidUp stores a refresh token to request access tokens to access your YouTube account. On sign out the refresh token is deleted. If you want to revoke VidUp’s access to your Google account/YouTube channel totally, you can do it in your Google account’s security settings: https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions.

Beside this it stores only the information you see and enter for uploads, templates, playlists and settings and some additional metadata it needs to manage this information like guids and timestamps. Finally it uploads the data you have entered to YouTube.

It receives and stores playlist information (title & playlist ID) from your channel on your request so that you can use the playlists in templates and uploads. If you want to add the playlist to a video after its publication, VidUp checks
* if the playlist exists on YouTube
* if the video exists on YouTube
* if video visibility of uploaded videos is public
* if the video is already contained in the playlist by receiving all videos in the playlist (the playlists videos are not stored permanently).

VidUp stores its data in json files in the ‚VidUp‘ folder in your user’s document folder.
